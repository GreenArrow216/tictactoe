## 🔍 SOLID Principles in Action

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component is responsible for a single piece of functionality.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Easily extend the app's functionality without modifying existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Abstractions and interfaces ensure seamless substitutions.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Modular interfaces tailored to specific functionalities.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Decoupled high-level modules and implementation details.
