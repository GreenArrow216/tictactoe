# Tic Tac Toe - A Modern Implementation Following SOLID Principles üéÆ

Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe**, a simple yet robust implementation of the classic game, designed with **SOLID principles** to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean code architecture. This project demonstrates my **frontend development skills**, focusing on writing clean, modular, and extensible code.

## üåü Features

- **Intuitive UI**: A responsive and minimalist design for an engaging user experience.
- **Scalable Codebase**: Built with the SOLID design principles in mind to facilitate easy future enhancements.
- **Frontend Excellence**: Clean and modular code showcasing advanced JavaScript and UI development skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Framework/Library**: [React]
- **CSS Styling**: [CSS]
- **Build Tools**: [Vite]

## üîç SOLID Principles in Action

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component is responsible for a single piece of functionality.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Easily extend the app's functionality without modifying existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Abstractions and interfaces ensure seamless substitutions.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Modular interfaces tailored to specific functionalities.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Decoupled high-level modules and implementation details.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git

## In future
1. Will be adding responsiveness.
2. Score board to see the local state.
3. Connecting with a Database and save scoreboard forever to tallypoints.
4. Will be adding scoreboard UI and backend implementation within the end of year.
